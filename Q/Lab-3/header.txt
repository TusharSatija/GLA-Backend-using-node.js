Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:

Request headers
Contain more information about the resource to be fetched, or about the client requesting the resource.

Response headers
Hold additional information about the response, like its location or about the server providing it.

Representation headers
Contain information about the body of the resource, like its MIME type, or encoding/compression applied.

Payload headers
Contain representation-independent information about payload data, including content length and the encoding used for transport.
